1. What I Built

I created a small HTML demo that applies transitions and animations using Tailwind CSS.
It showcases how Tailwind utilities make it easy to add hover effects, timing control, and smooth animations without writing custom CSS.

The demo includes:

A button that changes color and scales on hover.

A card that rotates and scales with a transition delay.

Bouncing text using a built-in animation.

A loading spinner using animate-spin.

A pulse effect box using animate-pulse.

2. How It Works

Transitions

transition, duration-300, duration-500 control how long transitions take.

hover:bg-blue-600, hover:scale-110, hover:rotate-3 define effects applied on hover.

ease-in-out, ease-out, and delays can be added for smoother control.

Animations

Built-in animations like animate-bounce, animate-spin, and animate-pulse add movement.

These use Tailwindâ€™s pre-defined keyframes and work immediately when applied as classes.

Combined Effects

Transitions and animations can be applied together to create interactive and visually appealing UI elements.

3. Expected Output

When you open the file in a browser:

The button smoothly changes color and scales up when hovered.

The card rotates slightly and enlarges on hover.

The purple text bounces continuously.

The circular spinner rotates endlessly.

The green box fades in and out in a pulsing effect.
