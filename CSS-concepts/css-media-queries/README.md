1. What I Built

I created a small HTML demo that showcases responsive design using Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js.
It demonstrates how Tailwind utilities make it easy to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes without writing custom CSS.

The demo includes:

A responsive navbar:

Large screens show icons + names.

Medium screens show icons only.

Small screens show a hamburger menu with icons and names.

A header with text that scales across screen sizes.

A responsive image that adjusts width based on breakpoints.

A card section that stacks vertically on small screens and switches to a side-by-side layout on medium and larger screens.

A grid section with 1 column on small screens, 2 columns on medium screens, and 3 columns on large screens.

Interactive hamburger menu using Alpine.js.

2. How It Works
Responsive Design

Tailwind classes like sm:, md:, lg: define breakpoints.

Layout utilities like md:flex or lg:inline adjust elements based on screen size.

The grid system (grid-cols-1, sm:grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-3) allows easy creation of responsive grids.

Navbar Interactivity

The hamburger menu is controlled by Alpine.js:

x-data="{ open: false }" stores state.

x-show="open" shows or hides the dropdown.

@click toggles the menu open/closed.

x-transition provides smooth animation.

On large screens, menu names appear alongside icons; on medium screens, only icons are shown.

3. Expected Output

When you open the file in a browser:

Navbar adapts to screen size:

Large: icons + names

Medium: icons only

Small: hamburger menu appears, click to show items

Header text scales with screen size.

Image resizes dynamically based on breakpoints.

Card layout switches between vertical and side-by-side based on screen width.

Grid layout adjusts from 1 → 2 → 3 columns as screen width increases.
