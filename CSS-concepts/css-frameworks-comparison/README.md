Comparison of Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Plain CSS

1. Plain CSS

1. Plain CSS is the base styling language for the web and does not depend on any external framework.
2. It offers full control over every aspect of styling, from layouts to animations.
3. Developers have to handle responsiveness, browser compatibility, and consistency on their own.
4. While powerful, it becomes repetitive and harder to manage as the project grows larger.
5. Learning plain CSS is essential because it builds a strong understanding of the fundamentals, which helps when working with frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap.

2. Bootstrap

1. Bootstrap provides a ready-to-use grid system that makes building responsive layouts straightforward.
2. It comes with a variety of pre-designed components such as buttons, modals, cards, and navigation bars.
3. It is beginner friendly and reduces the need to write CSS manually, which speeds up development.
4. Bootstrap ensures better cross-browser compatibility with minimal effort from the developer.
5. A common downside is that many Bootstrap projects tend to look similar unless developers put effort into customizing the styles.

3. Tailwind CSS

1. Tailwind CSS follows a utility-first approach, where developers apply small, single-purpose classes directly in HTML.
2. This approach removes the need to write a lot of custom CSS, making code more maintainable and less repetitive.
3. It offers flexibility to create unique designs while ensuring consistent styling across the project.
4. The learning curve can be steep initially since utility classes may feel overwhelming, but once understood, it becomes intuitive.
5. Tailwind speeds up development and is highly scalable, making it suitable for modern, customized web applications.

4. My Takeaways

1. Plain CSS is best for learning and small projects but becomes hard to maintain in larger, more complex applications.
2. Bootstrap is ideal for quickly setting up responsive layouts and basic UI components but can feel restrictive when customization is required.
3. Tailwind CSS combines flexibility and efficiency, and once learned, it becomes a very powerful tool for building modern, scalable, and unique designs.
